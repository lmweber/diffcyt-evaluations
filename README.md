# diffcyt-analysis

Analysis scripts for testing `diffcyt` methods, using several experimental and simulated data sets.

Development version of `diffcyt` package is available in the [diffcyt](https://github.com/lmweber/diffcyt) repository.


## Contents

Scripts are saved in the [scripts](scripts/) directory, and organized as follows:

- Scripts for evaluation of `diffcyt` methods. Saved in the [scripts/diffcyt](scripts/diffcyt/) directory, with subdirectories for each data set.

- Scripts for comparative evaluations of other methods: `Citrus`, `CellCnn`, and `cydar`. Organized into one directory per method, each containing subdirectories for each data set.
